1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent?
Explain why they are different, if they are. Explain why they can have
different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
//code fragment 1
$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
 $(e).css("color", "yellow"); });
//code fragment 2
$("li").each(function() {
 $(this).css("color", "yellow"); });
//code fragment 3
$("li").each(function(idx) {
 $(this).css("color", "yellow");
});

=> All three code fragments are equivalent. They are different only because of the parameters as the each
function takes two parameters index and element. when index is passed it provides the index of each element and
when both element is passed the element parameters acts as $(this) in that case.

2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include
an unordered list in them, and make their text color be blue.

=> $('div').find('ul').parent().css("color", "blue");
