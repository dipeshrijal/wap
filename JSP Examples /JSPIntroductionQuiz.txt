1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?
=> JSP is responsible for allowing to insert java code in HTML to make more dynamic with the help of JSP tags.

2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?
=> When client request for JSP page, the JSP engine ﬁrst checks whether the page is compiled into java class or not. If not, the JSP is translated
   into servlet. Then, the servlet is compiled into java class to produce the response.

3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?
=> JSP includes html with a little java. JSP runs on the server and HTML on the browser.

4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
=> JSP Scriptlet
   <body><html><% out.print("welcome" + name) %></body></html>

   JSP Servlet
   out.println("<html><body>");
   out.println("welcome" + name);
   out.println("</body></html>);

5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
=> JSP Declaration
   <body><html><%! int count = 0; %></body></html>

   JSP Servlet
   out.println("<html><body>");
   int count = 0;
   out.println("</body></html>);   

6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
=> JSP Comment
   <%-- comment --%>

   JSP Servlet
   // comment

7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
=> JSP Expression
   <% count++ %>

   JSP Servlet
   out.println(count++);


8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
=> JSP Directive
   <%@ page import="java.uti|.*" %>

   JSP Servlet
   import java.uti|.*;

9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
=> ${value}: container evaluates this as follows:
 	checks page scope for an attribute named "value",
 		if found use it.
	otherwise check request scope for an attribute named "value",
 		if found use it.
 	otherwise check session scope for an attribute named "value",
 		if found use it.
 	othenrvise check application scope for an attribute named "value",
 		if found use it.
 	otherwise ignore the expression.

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
=>  EL expressions assume that the first identiﬁer in the expression is the key of a servlet attribute, and searches through the different attribute 	 scopes using that key.

11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.
=>  The servlet asks the HttpRequest for RequestDispatcher, passing in a relative path to the view JSP using getRequestDispatcher() method. Then 	again, it calls fonNard() method on the RequestDispatcher, to tell the JSP to take over the request.
